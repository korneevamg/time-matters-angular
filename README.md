# TimeMatters

Who we are? Developers!

What do we want? To load data in our Angular application!

When do we want it? As soon as possible!

Many of us are familiar with component lifecycle hooks such as onInit or afterViewInit. What are other hooks that Angular gives us to load our data or to execute some code? In my talk I'm going to investigate it and put it on a time scale - from bootstrapping function to APP_INITIALIZER and resolvers. We will learn what code is executed first and last, creating a time perspective of an Angular application.

This project demonstrates the aspects that I cover in my talk.
